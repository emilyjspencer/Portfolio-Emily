       <p>From the moment I was handed a camera (a Christmas present from my father when I was twelve years old), I've enjoyed capturing moments in time through the lens, whether
           that be with a phone, an SLR or an old-school digital model.
           I enjoy, as many others do, looking back through old photographs of places I've been, people I've met,
           events I've been to or, simply moments captured with friends and family.
           I'm especially fond of the work of <a href="https://www.adambirdphotography.com/">Adam Bird</a> and <a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/annie-leibovitz/">Annie Leibovitz</a> - renowned for her portraits of public figures.
